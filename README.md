# ❤️ Heart Disease Prediction

This is a data science project using clinical data to predict the presence of heart disease in patients. The dataset is sourced from Kaggle and contains features such as age, cholesterol level, chest pain type, and more.

## 📊 Dataset

- **Source**: [Heart Disease UCI Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/heart-failure-prediction)
- **Format**: CSV file with multiple clinical features and a target variable indicating heart disease presence (1) or absence (0).

## 🧪 Technologies Used

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- NumPy, Pandas
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## 🧠 Project Steps

1. **Data Loading & Cleaning**  
   Load the CSV file, check for missing values, and explore the structure.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   Visualize feature distributions and relationships using bar plots, histograms, and heatmaps.

3. **Preprocessing**  
   Convert categorical variables to numerical format using Label Encoding or One-Hot Encoding.

4. **Model Training & Evaluation**  
   Use machine learning algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, KNN) to train and evaluate models.

5. **Performance Metrics**  
   Evaluate accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and visualize confusion matrix.

## 📌 Results

The best-performing model achieved an accuracy of over 80%, correctly identifying patients with or without heart disease based on the given clinical features.
